"""
This module extends the Monte Carlo Race Simulation framework to incorporate Genetic Algorithm optimization techniques.
It provides a hybrid approach that combines the stochastic sampling of Monte Carlo methods with the evolutionary
search capabilities of Genetic Algorithms to optimize race strategies.

The MCGeneticAlgorithmRaceSimulations class in this module allows for:
- Initialization of a population of race strategies
- Evaluation of strategies using Monte Carlo simulations
- Evolution of strategies through genetic operations (selection, crossover, mutation)
- Iterative improvement of strategies over multiple generations

This hybrid approach aims to efficiently explore the strategy space and find robust, high-performing race strategies
that can adapt to the uncertainties inherent motorsport.

    """
    A class that combines Monte Carlo simulations with Genetic Algorithm optimization for race strategy analysis.

    This class extends the MonteCarloRaceSimulations class to incorporate genetic algorithm techniques.
    It evolves a population of race strategies over multiple generations, using Monte Carlo simulations
    to evaluate the fitness of each strategy.

    Attributes:
        population_size (int): The number of strategies in each generation.
        generations (int): The number of generations to evolve the strategies.
        mutation_rate (float): The probability of mutation occurring in a strategy.

    The class provides methods for:
    - Initializing a population of strategies
    - Evaluating strategy fitness using Monte Carlo simulations
    - Performing genetic operations (selection, crossover, mutation)
    - Evolving the population over multiple generations
    - Running the full genetic algorithm optimization process

    This hybrid approach aims to find optimal race strategies that are robust across various race scenarios,
    leveraging the strengths of both Monte Carlo methods and Genetic Algorithms.
